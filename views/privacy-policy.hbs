    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
      privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
      United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
      Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
      the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more

      United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
      websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

      to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br><strong>In order to be in

      Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
      rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not
      only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
      courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
